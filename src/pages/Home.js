                This is a website dedicated to visualizing algorithms for educational purposes.
                The goal is to visualize as many algorithms as possible and help students learn
                these topics through visuals. There are many types of algorithms that we will discuss
                so we deicded to group them click on an algorithm you would like to learn more about from the options below.
            </p><h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2><p> Sorthing algorithms are some of the first algorithms that are taught when you first start
                your computer science journey. Although some of these algorithms are not used in real world applications it
                is good to way to adapt a new form a thinking. In computer science there is use of arrays and getting a basic understanding
                of indexes and and index values is a perfect place to start.
